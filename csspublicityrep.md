So why should you vote for me... Good question

This faithful reproduction of the CSS site should help

## CSS

I've been a CSS member for 3 years and have even occasionally come to some events when it's not just for the free pizza! <img alt="slice of pizza" src="/assets/css/slice-of-pizza.png" class="emoji">

Evidence, back before we were all stuck at home:

## ValeFest

I&apos;m part of the marketing team, the public face of ValeFest

- Position: Website and ticketing coordinator
- Length of Time: 2 years
- Festivals Cancelled: Only 1 (that's a 50% success rate I suppose)
- Role:
	- I help with the social media posts from ValeFest whilst also ensuring the website is kept up to date with them
	- I'm also in charge of ticketing! I developed the QR code based ticketing system we used last year for the 6500 or so attendees of the festival. I was given some ideas and made a working system.

The ValeFest committee 2019:

ValeFest ticketing is a horribly convoluted Guild mandated process. I've helped present to the guild a way of much simplifying it so, if ValeFest was actually going ahead this year, it would have been a much simpler process. This experience dealing with the guild is an advantage on any society's committee!

Apparently I'm also an amazing multitasker:

that might be useful...

## My Plans for CSS
- I'll bring my experience from ValeFest as a key part of the marketing team
	- I have real world experience with marketing both from my committee position in ValeFest and my year in industry so I know roughly what works and what doesn't.
	- This adds to my technical experience in web development
- I'd like to explore whether CSS can purchase a camera so we can take photos at more CSS events, not just the end of year ball
	- Apart from technical issues, it worked really well to share all these photos to the facebook group
	- This'll be invaluble to help with marketing the society to increase membership further
- Verification on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter

## This website:
- Is a github domain since I've not actually bought a domain name for myself yet
- Was written in Jekyll, the markdown/ruby based blogging language
	- Same as both the <a href="https://valefest.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ValeFest Website</a> and the <a href="https://cssbham.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSS website</a>
- Helped me get my year in industry placement ([Here](/) if you're interested)
- Is better than George's <img alt="winking face" src="/assets/css/winking-face.png" class="emoji">
